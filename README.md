PartyCrasher is a framework for automatically grouping crash reports
based on the contents of stack traces and other
data available at the time of a crash. You can read the [paper about it](https://peerj.com/preprints/1705/).

# Install

> Note that the provided `Dockerfile` is out of date.

PartyCrasher requires [Elastic (ElasticSearch)](https://www.elastic.co/).

To install the PartyCrasher REST client, install ElasticSearch; then
install the Python dependencies (you may want to install these within
a [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
if that's your taste).

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install the UI, you must have NPM.

```sh
cd ui
npm install
```

# Usage

Run the REST service:

```sh
make start
```

The HTTP service will now be listening on port 5000. Refer to the [API
Docs][] for further usage.

# Uploading Test Data

> **Note**: This will delete *all* data in the existing PartyCrasher
> instance.

To download test data and upload it to PartyCrasher, simply type:

```sh
$ make buckettest
```
